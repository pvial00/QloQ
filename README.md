# Q'loQ

*** Q'loQ - model X is the recommended cipher with a key length of 1536

Q'loQ, pronounced cloak is the Klingon High Command's Public Key encryption algorithm adopted from the Human algorithm ZRSA.

Q'loQ leaves P, Q, A and B open to detection but U it cloaks in shroud of darkness.  Like ZRSA It is resistant to Fermat's theorem.  It also introduces the concept of a mask which is a second modulus with which to encrypt with.  The hope is that the second modulus may close to double the encryption strength while keeping the key sizes the same.
